"Learning Object-Oriented Programming","Gaston C. Hillar","Learning Object-Oriented Programming is an easy-to-follow guide full of hands-on examples of solutions to common problems with object-oriented code in Python, JavaScript, and C#. It starts by helping you to recognize objects from real-life scenarios and demonstrates that working with them makes it simpler to write code that is easy to understand and reuse. You will learn to protect and hide data with the data encapsulation features of Python, JavaScript, and C#. You will explore how to maximize code reuse by writing code capable of working with objects of different types, and discover the advantage of duck typing in both Python and JavaScript, while you work with interfaces and generics in C#. With a fair understanding of interfaces, multiple inheritance, and composition, you will move on to refactor existing code and to organize your source for easy maintenance and extension. Learning Object-Oriented Programming will help you to make better, stronger, and reusable code.","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zicxCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=10&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"

"Object-Oriented Programming","Günther Blaschek","Object-oriented programming is a popular buzzword these days. What is the reason for this popularity? Is object-oriented programming the solution to the software crisis or is it just a fad? Is it a simple evolutionary step or a radical change in software methodology? What is the central idea behind object-orien ted design? Are there special applications for which object-oriented program ming is particularly suited? Which object-oriented language should be used? There is no simple answer to these questions. Although object-oriented programming was invented more than twenty years ago, we still cannot claim that we know everything about this programming technique. Many new con cepts have been developed during the past decade, and new applications and implications of object-oriented programming are constantly being discovered. This book can only try to explain the nature of object-oriented program ming in as much detail as possible. It should serve three purposes. First, it is intended as an introduction to the basic concepts of object-oriented program ming. Second, the book describes the concept of prototypes and explains why and how they can improve the way in which object-oriented programs are developed. Third, it introduces the programming language Omega, an object oriented language that was designed with easy, safe and efficient software development in mind.","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=akKqCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=10&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"

"Machine Learning","Giridhar Boray","Machine Learning (ML) is an intergral part of Artificial Intelligence which is finding increasing usage in applications such as autonomous driving, speech recognition, recommendation systems, intelligent search, population prediction etc. The explosive growth in Machine Learning is due to almost simultaneous availability of high processing power, high storage capacity and high network speed. There are many excellent books on Machine Learning which provide excellent theoretical treatment. There is an extensive library of routines (mostly in python) that one can use to quickly implement modern Machine Learning algorithms. This handbook attempts to provide a bridge between theoretical formulations of Machine Learning algorithms and implementations so that a practitioner can appreciate the theoretical underpinnings and develop the skills to modify or develop python routines from scratch instead of relying on bulit in routines always. This book attempts to cover 13 major Machine Learning algorithms - Linear Regression Learning, Logistic Regression Learning, k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) classification, Bayesian Learning, Decision Tree Learning, Random Forest Classifier, Principal Component Analysis, Artificial Neural Network Learning, k-Means Clustering, Reinforcement Learning, Support Vector Machines, Time Series Machine Learning, and Machine Learning with Adaptive Filters. These algorithms are implemented using commonly available tools such as Microsoft Excel and python. While many libraries and routine are available in implementing ML with languages such as Python, it is important for a practitioner to understand the basic theory behind the algorithms. This will enable one to develop customized solutions or modify available routines for specific problems or implement brand new algorithms for which there may not be ready made libraries or routines.","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Vdy0EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=10&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"

"Software Engineering","Richard F Schmidt","Software Engineering: Architecture-driven Software Development is the first comprehensive guide to the underlying skills embodied in the IEEE's Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK) standard. Standards expert Richard Schmidt explains the traditional software engineering practices recognized for developing projects for government or corporate systems. Software engineering education often lacks standardization, with many institutions focusing on implementation rather than design as it impacts product architecture. Many graduates join the workforce with incomplete skills, leading to software projects that either fail outright or run woefully over budget and behind schedule. Additionally, software engineers need to understand system engineering and architecture—the hardware and peripherals their programs will run on. This issue will only grow in importance as more programs leverage parallel computing, requiring an understanding of the parallel capabilities of processors and hardware. This book gives both software developers and system engineers key insights into how their skillsets support and complement each other. With a focus on these key knowledge areas, Software Engineering offers a set of best practices that can be applied to any industry or domain involved in developing software products. - A thorough, integrated compilation on the engineering of software products, addressing the majority of the standard knowledge areas and topics - Offers best practices focused on those key skills common to many industries and domains that develop software - Learn how software engineering relates to systems engineering for better communication with other engineering professionals within a project environment","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GndOWfOakzsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=10&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"

"Deep Learning","Siddhartha Bhattacharyya, Vaclav Snasel, Aboul Ella Hassanien, Satadal Saha, B. K. Tripathy","This book focuses on the fundamentals of deep learning along with reporting on the current state-of-art research on deep learning. In addition, it provides an insight of deep neural networks in action with illustrative coding examples. Deep learning is a new area of machine learning research which has been introduced with the objective of moving ML closer to one of its original goals, i.e. artificial intelligence. Deep learning was developed as an ML approach to deal with complex input-output mappings. While traditional methods successfully solve problems where final value is a simple function of input data, deep learning techniques are able to capture composite relations between non-immediately related fields, for example between air pressure recordings and English words, millions of pixels and textual description, brand-related news and future stock prices and almost all real world problems. Deep learning is a class of nature inspired machine learning algorithms that uses a cascade of multiple layers of nonlinear processing units for feature extraction and transformation. Each successive layer uses the output from the previous layer as input. The learning may be supervised (e.g. classification) and/or unsupervised (e.g. pattern analysis) manners. These algorithms learn multiple levels of representations that correspond to different levels of abstraction by resorting to some form of gradient descent for training via backpropagation. Layers that have been used in deep learning include hidden layers of an artificial neural network and sets of propositional formulas. They may also include latent variables organized layer-wise in deep generative models such as the nodes in deep belief networks and deep boltzmann machines. Deep learning is part of state-of-the-art systems in various disciplines, particularly computer vision, automatic speech recognition (ASR) and human action recognition.","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OlXrDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=10&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"

"Deep Learning","Christopher M. Bishop, Hugh Bishop","This book offers a comprehensive introduction to the central ideas that underpin deep learning. It is intended both for newcomers to machine learning and for those already experienced in the field. Covering key concepts relating to contemporary architectures and techniques, this essential book equips readers with a robust foundation for potential future specialization. The field of deep learning is undergoing rapid evolution, and therefore this book focusses on ideas that are likely to endure the test of time. The book is organized into numerous bite-sized chapters, each exploring a distinct topic, and the narrative follows a linear progression, with each chapter building upon content from its predecessors. This structure is well-suited to teaching a two-semester undergraduate or postgraduate machine learning course, while remaining equally relevant to those engaged in active research or in self-study. A full understanding of machine learning requires some mathematical background and so the book includes a self-contained introduction to probability theory. However, the focus of the book is on conveying a clear understanding of ideas, with emphasis on the real-world practical value of techniques rather than on abstract theory. Complex concepts are therefore presented from multiple complementary perspectives including textual descriptions, diagrams, mathematical formulae, and pseudo-code. Chris Bishop is a Technical Fellow at Microsoft and is the Director of Microsoft Research AI4Science. He is a Fellow of Darwin College Cambridge, a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering, and a Fellow of the Royal Society. Hugh Bishop is an Applied Scientist at Wayve, a deep learning autonomous driving company in London, where he designs and trains deep neural networks. He completed his MPhil in Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence at Cambridge University. “Chris Bishop wrote a terrific textbook on neural networks in 1995 and has a deep knowledge of the field and its core ideas. His many years of experience in explaining neural networks have made him extremely skillful at presenting complicated ideas in the simplest possible way and it is a delight to see these skills applied to the revolutionary new developments in the field.” -- Geoffrey Hinton ""With the recent explosion of deep learning and AI as a research topic, and the quickly growing importance of AI applications, a modern textbook on the topic was badly needed. The ""New Bishop"" masterfully fills the gap, covering algorithms for supervised and unsupervised learning, modern deep learning architecture families, as well as how to apply all of this to various application areas."" – Yann LeCun “This excellent and very educational book will bring the reader up to date with the main concepts and advances in deep learning with a solid anchoring in probability.
